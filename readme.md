I done this project accroding to some React course from Udemy.
It is mostly React project with all packages installed manually step by step without RCA.
Due to that I learnt how should looks creating some "bigger" Api/project from scratch with good practices and all of the programming stages from installing packages to uplading saves/commits and pushing it into github.
